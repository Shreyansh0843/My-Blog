## How we built it üßë‚Äçüíª
We embarked on building our environment entirely from scratch, leveraging the power of backend technologies. Our primary tools include Node.js and Express.js, which we utilized to craft our backend application. For structuring our website, we employed EJS, enhancing it with a single CSS file to beautify the overall appearance. This meticulous approach ensures a seamless and visually appealing user experience on our platform.
